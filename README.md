# campaneo_app

An application to build a trusted platform for sensor data sharing and raising a user's awareness about their GDPR rights.

## Current limitations:

- Campaign expiration dates are not taken into consideration.
- Colour theme switching not supported (make us of themeManager).
- Requested sensors are hard-coded and not retrieved from KG.
- Consenting not done in KG, only locally on app.
- Livetracker only works for Android.
- When navigating to LiveTracker -> Add in the user ID (once implemented) to get that specific user's live tracking view
