# campaneo_app

An application to build a trusted platform for sensor data sharing.

## To-Do:

- First hardcoded data to check if the widgets suit the design.
- Differentiate ActiveCampaign page and NewCampaignPage by listing only the requested campaigns.
- Build CouponShop.
- Add Settings Iconbutton and navigate to settings screen.
- Adjust themeManager to the user's entered colour theme.
- Connect to the GraphQL and use that data for the application as soon as the design is good.
